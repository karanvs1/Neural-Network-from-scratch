# Neural Network from scratch
This repo contains the code for a neural network from scratch. The code is written in python and uses numpy for matrix operations. The code is written in a modular fashion and can be used to build any neural network. The code is written in a way that it can be used to build any neural network with any number of layers and any number of neurons in each layer. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc. The code is also written in a way that it can be used to build any type of neural network, i.e. a binary classifier, a multi-class classifier, a regression model, etc
